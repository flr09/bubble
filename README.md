The MechaBubble is a one-of-a-kind mechanical art piece resembling a bubble.The code, PCB layout, and STL files are openly sourced, allowing all to contribute, adapt, and bring their own versions of the project to life. Initially capped at 10 pieces, this device offers exclusivity and artistry.



## The Elektrobuero MechaBubble Project

Welcome to the exciting world of Elektrobuero's MechaBubble. This unique device is a combination of art and technology that evokes fascination through its movement along one axis. It takes the simple joy of a bubble and transforms it into an elegant, mechanized marvel that's simple to operate - just press a button and watch the magic unfold.

### Technology behind MechaBubble
Underneath the captivating exterior, MechaBubble is powered by a set of sophisticated components. The movement is controlled by a TMC 2209 stepper driver operating in silent mode, coupled with a stepper motor, ensuring smooth and noiseless operation. The brains behind the operation is a Raspberry Pi Pico, orchestrating the perfect dance of our mechanized bubble.

The PCB, which forms the backbone of MechaBubble, has been meticulously designed and developed in-house at Elektrobuero. Our aim has been to engineer a perfect harmony of technology that yields an enchanting piece of art.

### Open Source Documentation
In line with our belief in open collaboration and shared knowledge, all design files and codebase related to the MechaBubble project will be publicly available on this GitHub page. This includes our PCB layout, the software code, as well as the STL files for 3D printing components. Whether you are a tech enthusiast wanting to build upon our design, or a customer interested in customizing the art piece, you're welcome to dive into the details.

### Limited Edition Release
As part of our initial release, we are excited to offer the first version of MechaBubble as a limited edition - with only 10 pieces available. Each piece represents an exquisite fusion of art and technology that has been carefully crafted to provide a mesmerizing experience.


We invite you to be a part of the Elektrobuero MechaBubble journey, a blend of technology, innovation, and art that transcends boundaries. Stay tuned for our release in October, and we look forward to seeing how you interact with, modify, and redefine the MechaBubble.
